Homework 2
================

*Note: This homework uses the `tidyverse`, `dplyr`, and `readxl`
libraries.*

## Problem 1

The `nyctransit_df` dataset (32 columns x 1868 rows) was created based
on the *“NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv”* file.

After reading the `nyctransit_df` dataset and taking a look at its 32
variables with `summary(nyctransit_df)`, I applied the snake case
convention to the variable names using `clean_names` from the `janitor`
package.

Using the `select()` function, I selected my variables of interest and
converted the `entry` variable in this dataset from character to a
logical variable.

The resulting `nyctransit_q1` dataset (19 columns x 1868 rows) has 19
variables (11 characters, 2 logicals, and 6 doubles).

#### The 19 Variables in `nyctransit_q1`

*Note: To see the categories in some of the character and double
variables, I transformed them into factors and created the
`nyctransit_fc` dataset. Then I used the `levels(pull())` function to
look at the categories.*

In the `nyvtransit_q1` dataset, the 11 character variables include:
`line` (36 different lines), `station_name` (356 different names),
`route1` to `route7`, `entrance_type` (Door, Easement, Elevator,
Escalator, Ramp, Stair, Walkway), and `vending` (y/n).

The 2 logical variables are `ada`, which indicates whether it is ADA
compliant, and `entry`.

The 6 double variables are `station_latitude`, `station_longitude`, and
`route8` to `route11`.

The data in `nyctransit_q1` is not tidy. For example, Routes 8 to 11
were entered as doubles but it is a categorical variable. Similarly,
character variables such as `line`, `entrance_type`, `vending`, and
`route1` to `route7` are categorical variables and could be converted to
factors.

#### Problem 1 Question Answers

There are 356 distinct stations. 73 out of the 356 stations are ADA
compliant. Of the 36 distinct stations that have entrances/exits without
vending, 16 (44.44%) allow entrance.

#### Reformatting Data

After reformatting the data, we find that 56 distinct stations serve the
A train.

Of the stations that serve the A train, 16 are ADA compliant.

## Problem 2

Problem 2 uses the *“202409 Trash Wheel Collection Data”* xlsx file from
Mr. Trash Wheel.

#### Summary of Data

3 sheets from the xlsx file (Mr. Trash Wheel, Professor Trash Wheel,
Gwynnda Trash Wheel) have been read, cleaned with the `clean_names`
function, and imported. An additional variable `trash_wheel_name` was
created for all three datasets:

- `mr. rrash` (651 x 15),
- `prof_trash` (118 x 14), and  
- `gwynnda_trash` (262 x 13).

`year` was standardized to a factor variable in all three to allow later
merging of the datasets. Entries in the `sports_ball` variable has been
converted to integers for `mr. trash` only.

After merging, the resulting dataset `Combined_Trash` has 1031
observations and 15 variables. Examples of key variables include:

- `trash_wheel_name` lists the specific names of the trash wheels
- `dumpster` the dumpster number
- Date is specified by the `year`, `month`, and `date` variables
- `weight_tons` and `volume_cubic_yards` of collected trash
- Trash categories include `plastic_bottles`, `polystyrene`,
  `cigarette_butts`, `glass_bottles`, `plastic_bags`, `wrappers`,
  `sports_balls`
- `homes_powered`

The total weight of trash collected by Professor Trash Wheel was 246.74
tons.

In June of 2022, Gwynnda collected a total of 1.812^{4} cigarette butts.
