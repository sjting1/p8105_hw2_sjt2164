Homework 2
================

*Note: This homework uses the `tidyverse` and `dplyr` libraries.*

## Problem 1

The `nyctransit_df` dataset (32 columns x 1868 rows) was created based
on the *“NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv”* file.

After reading the `nyctransit_df` dataset and taking a look at its 32
variables with `summary(nyctransit_df)`, I applied the snake case
convention to the variable names using `clean_names` from the `janitor`
package.
