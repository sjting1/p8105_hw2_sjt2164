Homework 2
================

*Note: This homework uses the `tidyverse` and `dplyr` libraries.*

## Problem 1

The `nyctransit_df` dataset (32 columns x 1868 rows) was created based
on the *“NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv”* file.

After reading the `nyctransit_df` dataset and taking a look at its 32
variables with `summary(nyctransit_df)`, I applied the snake case
convention to the variable names using `clean_names` from the `janitor`
package.

Using the `select()` function, I selected my variables of interest and
converted the `entry` variable in this dataset from character (YES vs
NO) to a logical variable (TRUE vs. FALSE).

The resulting `nyctransit_q1` dataset has 19 columns and 1,868 rows. The
19 variables include 11 characters, 2 logicals, and 6 doubles.

#### The 19 Variables in `nyctransit_q1`

*Note: To see the categories in some of the character and double
variables, I transformed them into factors and created the
`nyctransit_fc` dataset. Then I used the `levels(pull())` function to
look at the categories.*
