_Note: This homework uses the `tidyverse` and `dplyr` libraries._
```{r setup, include = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
```

## Problem 1

```{r data, include = FALSE}
nyctransit_df = read_csv("./data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv")
nyctransit_df #1,868 entries and 32 columns.
```

The `nyctransit_df` dataset (`r ncol(nyctransit_df)` columns x `r nrow(nyctransit_df)` rows) was created based on the _"NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv"_ file.

```{r summary, include = FALSE}
summary(nyctransit_df)
nyctransit_df = janitor::clean_names(nyctransit_df) #transform variable names to snake case
```

After reading the `nyctransit_df` dataset and taking a look at its 32 variables with `summary(nyctransit_df)`, I applied the snake case convention to the variable names using `clean_names` from the `janitor` package.
